#### Introduction
Python being an Interpreted Language it is easy to evaluate things line by line.Hence, the code is not bounded by some kind of block rather the lines can be individually be run.
#### Need of a Notebook file
The best thing about the idea of a `notebook` is we can group some lines by a cell or can run a single line of code as needed.
#### Need of an online remote platform aka cloud for our project
See, most of the time, we have a limited and old architecture which underperforms in most of the cases. A cloud architecture is realized in such a way that it is highly scalabe and can utilize the computational power as needed. And the nice thing is the management of the bigtech has so much computational power in spare that they offer quite a wholesome amount of it as a promotional perk. And this can be used for our day to day small applications.

#### Cloud platforms considerations (2022)
For comparison, we will consider five most used and most preferred technologies.
    - Datalore :
        This mightbe the easiest one to pick. It has quite faster interface and looks alike other Jetbrain's product. It has one thing that anyother platform lacks that is powerful IDE suggestions and on the fly error detector. It is the best for debugging and rapid building. It has a nice User Interface that can be understood in minutes. It has a very good schedular capability that makes it more reliable. But the downside is the computational power is quite low and its bandwidth is not that much.

    - MyBinder :
        This is another easy to pick choice. It uses github and highly depends on it. But has a nice jupyter like interface.

    - Kernels :
        This is best suite for competitive notebook works. It has the best resource and has a very powerful bandwith supply. It has the best and most active community. Best for learning.
    
    - Colab :
        It is quite easy to start with. But has its own demerits as well. Colab gives quite a good amount of computational power but can't retain kernel configurations for a long time. More power can be added as need paying extra money.
    - Deepnote :
        Lastly this is the one I personally look forward to. This is the one thing to fulfill all the needs. It has a lot of features that mostly no one requires at the very first. It gives quite a good computation power and storage. The storage can hold a state for quite some time. The computational power can be increased with a students account and it supports all the version of the python.

#### Comparative Data
| Technology | Patron | Ram | Storage | Pluses | Minuses | Price |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| MyBinder | Jupyter | 1-2gb | Unknown | Jupyter like interface | Slower | Free |
| Kernels | Kaggle | upto 17gb | 100gb | Very resourceful | Not nice interface | Free |
| Colab | Google | Unknown | Unknown | Easy to start | Python version is not updated | Free |
| Datalore | Jetbrains | 2gb | 10gb | Easiest Environment | Python version is not updated | Proprietary |
| Deepnote | Deepnote | 4.5gb | Unknown | All possible features | Sluggish Website | Proprietary/ Students plan |

#### Conclusion
If you are smart and have a functioning brain, you must choose Deepnote for now (2022).
